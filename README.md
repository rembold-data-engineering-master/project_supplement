# Data 503 Final Project Supplementary Info

Within this repository you should add the requested supplementary material for the final project. That includes:

- [ ] A copy of your presentation slides (or a link to them if Google slides)
- [ ] A full ER diagram for each members data, plus their combination
- [ ] Some info about how you were serving the data
    - If this was through the API, a basic document describing your different endpoints and why you chose them. Include the URL to your root endpoint!
    - If this was through a PowerBI dashboard, ideally this would be a link to your published dashboard. If you can't get the dashboard published though, it should instead be a link to a short video (< 4 mins) of you showcasing the various aspects of your dashboard and talking through what they accomplish and why you included them.

Organize and name the files that are uploaded to this repository clearly so that I can easily find everything. While you can include extra information if you want, this is all that is required, and all that I promise I will actually look at!
