# Data 503 Final Project Supplementary Info

Within this repository you should add the requested supplementary material for the final project. That includes:

- [ ] A copy of your presentation slides (or a link to them if Google slides)
- [ ] A full ER diagram for _each_ member's data, plus their combination
- [ ] A link to your PostgREST API, and a link to your SwaggerUI if you were able to add it
- [ ] A link to your dashboard. If this was an externally linked dashboard, all I need is the link. If an internal dashboard, I will need the user info (name and password) I can log in as. Make sure that user has read permissions for your dashboard!

Organize and name the files that are uploaded to this repository clearly so that I can easily find everything. While you can include extra information if you want, this is all that is required, and all that I promise I will actually look at!
